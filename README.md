## ðŸ§ª Environment Setup

To reproduce the results or run the notebooks:

Make sure [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is installed.

Open Git CMD or Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate implicit_sindy



##  Environment Setup
To reproduce the results or run the notebooks:

Make sure Miniconda or Anaconda is installed.

Open Git CMD or Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate implicit_sindy

This will create and activate the environment with all required packages.

##  Running the Code
After activating the environment, launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook

Open and run any of the Jupyter notebooks (e.g., Combined_SINDy_ETIN.ipynb) to reproduce the model fitting, equation extraction, and plotting.

## Dependencies
This project uses Python 3.10 with the following key packages:

pysindy
sympy
scikit-learn, scipy, numpy, pandas
matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
graphviz

All dependencies are listed in environment.yml.
